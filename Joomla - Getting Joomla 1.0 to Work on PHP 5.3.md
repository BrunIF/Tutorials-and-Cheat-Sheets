# Joomla - Getting Joomla 1.0 to Work on PHP 5.3

By Jack Szwergold, October 5, 2015

If you somehow have the misfortune to deal with keeping an ancient Joomla 1.0 install up and running on a modern server running Apache with PHP 5.3 or higher, this is what you need to do.

***

### First, edit `/includes/Cache/Lite/Function.php`.

Open up the `/includes/Cache/Lite/Function.php`v

    nano /var/www/joomla_1_x/includes/Cache/Lite/Function.php

Find this chunk of code:

	$arguments = func_get_args();

And replace it with this code:

	$arguments = func_get_args();
	$numargs = func_num_args();
	for($i=1; $i < $numargs; $i++){
	  $arguments[$i] = &$arguments[$i];
	}

### Next, edit `/includes/vcard.class.php`.

Open up the `/includes/vcard.class.php` file like this:

    sudo nano /var/www/joomla_1_x/includes/vcard.class.php

Now wrap the code around lines 38 to 77 in this conditional:

	if(!function_exists('quoted_printable_encode'))
	{
	  /* line 38 to 77 */
	}
