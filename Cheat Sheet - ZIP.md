### Basic Compression

#### Create a basic Zip archive.

To create an encrypted Zip with full directory paths do this. The `-r` option is for recursing directory paths.

    zip -r [zip file name] [path to directory]

#### Create a basic Zip archive without direcory paths.

And to create an encrypted Zip *without* directory paths do this. The `-r` option is for recursing directory paths and the `-j` option is for “junking the paths”; meaning just store the name of a saved file, and do not store directory names:

	zip -jr [zip file name] [path to directory]

### Encrypted Compression

#### Create an encrypted Zip archive.

To create an encrypted Zip with full directory paths do this. The `-e` option is for encryption and the `-r` option is for recursing directory paths.

    zip -er [zip file name] [path to directory]

#### Create an encrypted Zip archive without direcory paths.

And to create an encrypted Zip *without* directory paths do this. The `-e` option is for encryption, the `-r` option is for recursing directory paths and the `-j` option is for “junking the paths”; meaning just store the name of a saved file, and do not store directory names:

	zip -ejr [zip file name] [path to directory]

### Decompression

#### Decompress a Zip archive.

To uncompress a Zip archive, just do this:

    unzip [zip file name]

#### Decompress a Zip archive to a specific directory.

And to uncompress a Zip archive to a specific directory, just do this. The `-d` option is there to specify an output destination  directory:

    unzip [zip file name] -d [path to destination directory]
