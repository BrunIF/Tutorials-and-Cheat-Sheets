# Telephony - Sending an SMS via Email

Havenâ€™t tested these in a while but sending an email to a cell number on any of the following email addresses should send a message to that cell number.

For example, if 212-555-1212 is on Sprint, then to send 212-555-1212 a text message just send an email to the following email address:

    2125551212@messaging.sprintpcs.com

Here are the details on other U.S. providers

Sprint email to SMS address format:

    [10 digit cell phone number]@messaging.sprintpcs.com

Nextel email to SMS address format:

    [10 digit cell phone number]@messaging.nextel.com

AT&T email to SMS address format:

    [10 digit cell phone number]@txt.att.net

U.S. Cellular email to SMS address format:

    [10 digit cell phone number]email.uscc.net
